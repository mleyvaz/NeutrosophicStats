# Companion github repository  Latam NSS Special issue Vol 43.

Neutrosophy has given way to its research method for a transdisciplinary study that crosses the boundaries
between the sciences. The neutrosophic research method is a generalization of Hegel's dialectics (dynamics of
opposites: <A> and <antiA>). It suggests that scientific and humanistic research will progress by studying the
opposite ideas and the neutral ideas related to them to have a broader view of the whole problem to be solved.
These ideas are based on neutrosophy (study of opposites and their neutrals: <A> and <antiA> and <neutA>),
a new philosophy created by the Romanian-born researcher Florentin Smarandache.
 
This special issue  reflects the impact of neutrosophic theory in Latin America, especially after creating the
Latin American Association of Neutrosophic Sciences. Among the areas of publication most addressed in the
region are found in the interrelation of social sciences and neutrosophy, presenting outstanding results in these
research areas.
 
The main objective of this special issue is to divulge the impact publication related to the Neutrosophic theory
and explore new areas of research and application in the region. The SI reflects the influence of the neutrosophic
publications in Latin America by opening new research areas mainly related to Neutrosophic Statistics,
Plithogeny, and NeutroAlgebra.
 
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning the incorporation of authors from new countries in the region, such as
Paraguay, Uruguay, and Panama, to have authors in total from 15 countries, 12 of them from the Latin American
region.
 
We are thankful to Prof Florentin Smarandache for his continuous support. The editors firmly believe that this
SI will be helpful for researchers working on all aspects related to neutrosophic research, especially in social
sciences.
